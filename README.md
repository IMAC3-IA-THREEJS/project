Ecosystems is a project developed by 3rd year IMAC students in the Artificial Intelligence course. The purpose of the project is to experience a 3d interactive world in a web browser. There is a total of 8 different biomes to discover and many trophies to unlock by roaming and searching the worlds.

The project uses three.js for the rendering, React for the user interface, and tensorflow for voice commands recognition. Use a desktop version of Chrome or Firefox for an optimal experience.
