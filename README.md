Ecosystems is a project developed by 3rd year IMAC students in the Artificial Intelligence course. The purpose of the project is to experience a 3d interactive world in a web browser. There is a total of 8 different biomes to discover and many trophies to unlock.

The project uses three.js for the rendering, React/SASS for the user interface, and tensorflow for voice commands recognition. Use a desktop version of Chrome for an optimal experience.
